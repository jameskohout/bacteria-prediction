# bacteria-prediction

Notebook from Kaggle competition. Here is the description:

>For this challenge, you will be predicting bacteria species based on repeated lossy measurements of DNA snippets. Snippets of length 10 are analyzed using Raman spectroscopy that calculates the histogram of bases in the snippet. In other words, the DNA segment  becomes .
>
>Each row of data contains a spectrum of histograms generated by repeated measurements of a sample, each row containing the output of all 286 histogram possibilities (e.g.,  to ), which then has a bias spectrum (of totally random ATGC) subtracted from the results.
>
>The data (both train and test) also contains simulated measurement errors (of varying rates) for many of the samples, which makes the problem more challenging.
